## TODO

1. The Project README includes a description of the project, as well as instructions for installation and launch
2. fix styles base on: https://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/javascript.html
3. finish card detail option
  - The details page for a product shows a photo of the product, the name, the price, and the description
  - for more check: https://learn.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd0067/parts/cd0294/lessons/bfa4c2d6-f6db-46d5-a163-5210ca31ef1b/concepts/d093f1ea-7190-49e9-b58d-ed80efcb5a9b
4. connect frontend to backend ( db-migrate for basic products, add variables to product, pull in Product service from Backend.)
  - The list of products is retrieved from an external API or by using the HttpClient service to read the provided data.json file.
5. add "Products can be removed from the cart" feature
